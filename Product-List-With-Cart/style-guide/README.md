Product List With Cart

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the products in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to populate the UI dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to: 

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
